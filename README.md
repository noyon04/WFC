# WFC
The Weekend Fitness Club (WFC) project seeks to develop an effective and user-friendly 
scheduling system for fitness lovers looking for a structured way to plan and participate in 
numerous exercise sessions over the weekends. Users of the system can access a timetable, 
schedule classes, modify or cancel those reservations, attend sessions, and offer feedback 
through ratings and reviews. The WFC project ensures efficient and dependable operations for 
both clients and fitness clubs by utilizing Java programming language and H2 integrated 
database. The project's design, implementation, and testing processes are covered in full in this 
paper, which demonstrates the project's applicability and efficiency in streamlining the booking 
process for fitness classes. The WFC project significantly improves the overall user experience 
by addressing the need for a more convenient and organized system and paves the way for 
further developments in the management of fitness clubs
